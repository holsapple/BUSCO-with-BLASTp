This repository is an attempt to incorporate the use of BLASTp into BUSCO.

The original modifications made during Fall 2016 are not tracked in this GitHub repo.
Please review the file "pre-GitHub-mods.txt" for a detailed list of modifications prior to tracking.

This process has not been completed as of 4-14-2017.
There are still a few (fixable?) integration issues.
An explanation of the remaining issues is found in "bugs-to-fix.txt".

If you want to run this BUSCO mod on a sample data set, follow the command line instructions in "BUSCO_with_BLASTp.txt".

Since I am including the original BUSCO (v2.0) code in this repository in addition to my modifications, 
I am including the info from the README file in the BUSCO (v2.0) repo. It is found at the bottom of
this file, below the line.
